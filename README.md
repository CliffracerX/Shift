# Shift
A puzzle game originally made in 72 hours by CliffracerX, for Ludum Dare 35.

This is licensed under a personal "mostly do whatever the hell you want" sort of license.  You're free to use this, in part or whole, in your own non-commercial projects, however, it's necessary to keep this file with whatever you use.
In slightly-less-legal jargon, that's "You can tweak it and prod it to your heart's content, but if you release your, you need to give attribution to me as the original coder, and keep it under the same license."
I'd use the GPL or Creative Commons here, since those are bigger, however, they may not exactly suit my needs, and may conflict with one another, so it seems better to make a quick and personal sort of license.
